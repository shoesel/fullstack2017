**Building the Web of Things**
*One Layer at a time*
- How to connect IoT devices using web-standards (HTTP, JSON, WebSockets,...)
-- Gateways (protocol converters)
-- Native JS support (e.g. node or similar on device)
- Web can support solving issues on different layers (protocol, share, combine,...)
-- different tools already exist for web that can be used (Node RED)
- Field is in teenage-stage (may get to mature-stage some day..or not)
- Main issues (with web-capabilities)
-- Energy consumption higher
-- Less optimization
-- Encapsulation from vendors
